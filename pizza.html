        <h1>Pizza</h1>
            <p>This incredable recipe was gifted to me from my beloved Italian stepfather. He was a man of great taste
                and reputation. His love for great food and his will to make only the very best is proven in this 
                fantastic, delectible dish. I truly hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.
            </p>

        </ol>
        <h2><strong>Toppings</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
          <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium 
             bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining 
             paste .</li>
        </ul>
          <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. 
             Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
             Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        </ul>
          <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
             Add more flour, if needed. 
             (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        </ul> 
          <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased 
             pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
        <ul> 
          <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni 
             and cheese.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, 
             rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ul>
